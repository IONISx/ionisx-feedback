## Development environment

For the code quality environment, you need to install both Python and JavaScript requirements.

Run the following:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install

Then, preferably in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io), run

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Then, run `grunt test` to assess code quality.
